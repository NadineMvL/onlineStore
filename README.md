# Online Store Project

## Description of Project

Project was an assignment on Web Dev Bootcamp. Instructions were to create an online shopping cart using HTML, CSS & vanilla Javascript. There is a catalogue page and each product has an individual page. The check out page summarises the items selected and calculates final total depending which delivery method is selected. When order is placed a reference number is created. 

## Table of Contents

## Installation
I would suggest downloading all files and save into one folder and open in Visual Studio Code, run Live Server from there

## How to use Online Store
Open index1.html in the browser, the catalogue will be displayed
